# Lumina AI: Personal AI Assistant Application

## Overview

I developed Lumina AI, a web application powered by ReactJS and Google Generative AI, designed to function as a personal AI assistant. This project involved implementing robust features for users to input prompts, fetch real-time data, and access previous search results seamlessly. The user interface was meticulously crafted to prioritize usability and accessibility, showcasing my proficiency in ReactJS, adept API integration skills, and adherence to modern web design principles.

## Features

- **Prompt Input**: Users can enter prompts to interact with the AI.
- **Data Fetching**: Efficient retrieval of data based on user input.
- **Search History**: View past searches and retrieve previous search results.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable to various screen sizes and devices.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Visually appealing and easy to navigate.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Google Generative AI
- **Version Control**: Git
