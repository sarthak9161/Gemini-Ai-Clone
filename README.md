# Lumina AI

## Overview

I created this Lumina AI project using ReactJS and Google Generative AI to replicate the core functionalities of the other ai application. This responsive web app allows users to enter prompts, fetch data, view past searches, and retrieve previous search results. This project highlights my expertise in ReactJS, API integration, and web design.

## Features

- **Prompt Input**: Users can enter prompts to interact with the AI.
- **Data Fetching**: Efficient retrieval of data based on user input.
- **Search History**: View past searches and retrieve previous search results.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable to various screen sizes and devices.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Visually appealing and easy to navigate.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Google Generative AI
- **Version Control**: Git
